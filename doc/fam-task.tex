\label{cha:fam-tasks}

This chapter describes \MzFam's high-level interface, which,
hopefully, will fulfil all you file monitoring needs (if that's not
the case you can either \urlh{mailto:jao@gnu.org}{bug me} to improve the
interface or roll your own using the low-level interface detailed in
subsequent chapters).

We begin with some concrete usage examples in
section~\ref{sec:basic-usage} to get the gist of how FAM tasks work
(as you'll see, there's no rocket science involved), followed by a
review of some knobs you can use to customize their behaviour in
section~\ref{sec:nuts-bolts}. Finally, section~\ref{sec:fam-events}
tells you all you need to know about what and when FAM events are
generated by the system in response to file alterations.

\section{Basic usage}
\label{sec:basic-usage}

A FAM task is just a thread that monitors a set of files or
directories. Whenever it notices a change in any of them, the task
checks whether you've expressed interest on being notified for that
kind of change and invokes the corresponding procedure (also provided
by you as a token of your interest) with a so-called \textit{FAM
  event} as its argument. A FAM event is just a struct containing the
monitored path, the path of the altered file (which may be different
from the monitored path when the latter is a directory), a symbol (or
\textit{event type}) describing the type of alteration (file modified,
created, deleted and so on) and a timestamp.

So, using FAM tasks is a simple matter of:
\begin{itemize}
\item Creating a FAM task instance using \scm{(fam-task-create)}.
\item Registering one or more paths to be monitored (using
  \scm{fam-task-add-path}), providing, for each one, a procedure
  handling events and, optionally, a list of event types you're
  interested on.
\item Starting (or joining) the FAM task using \scm{fam-task-start}
  (\scm{fam-task-join}).
\end{itemize}
Let us spell out this process in a fully functional, if a bit silly,
program:
\scm{
(require (planet "fam-task.ss" ("jao" "mzfam.plt" 1 0)))

(define ft (fam-task-create))

(define (display-event event)
  (let ((mp (fam-event-monitored-path event))
        (p (fam-event-path event))
        (type (fam-event-type->string (fam-event-type event)))
        (time (fam-event-timestamp event)))
    (printf "~A: ~A while monitoring ~A (~A)~%" p type mp time)))

(when (fam-task-add-path ft "/home/jao/tmp" display-event)
  (fam-task-join ft))

(error "Ooops, fam task exited unexpectedly!")
}
The above code shows the four selectors available to extract relevant
information from FAM events you receive, besides an otherwise useless
function that comes in handy when writing tutorial snippets. You can
also see the most simple way of adding a path to the set monitored by
a FAM task (using \scm{fam-task-add-path}). Note that the monitoring
thread is not started until we call \scm{fam-task-join}, which, in
addition, makes the current thread wait on the FAM task's. The
alternative is to use \scm{fam-task-start}, which returns after
spawning the monitoring thread and let's you go on with your business.
Those business may include, incidentally, adding new paths to be
monitored or removing previously added ones (as in
\scm{(fam-task-remove-path ft "/home/jao/tmp")}), or even stoping the
monitoring task (\scm{(fam-task-stop ft)}). This slightly more
interesting program exercises all those abilities:
\scm{
(require (planet "fam-task.ss" ("jao" "mzfam.plt" 1 0)))

(define ft (fam-task-create))

(define (display-event event)
  ;; as above ...)

(unless (fam-task-start ft)
  (error "Could not start monitoring task"))

(printf "Monitoring using ~A started~%"
        (if (fam-use-native?) "scheme FAM" "FAM/Gamin daemon"))

(define (display-event event)
  (printf "* ~A: ~A (~A)~%"
          (fam-event-path event)
          (fam-event-type->string (fam-event-type event))
          (fam-event-monitored-path event)))

(define (read-op)
  (printf "(a)dd, (r)emove, (s)uspend, r(e)sume, (p)rint, (q)uit: ")
  (let ((op (read))) (read-line) op))

(define (read-path) (printf "Path: ") (read-line))

(let loop ((op (read-op)))
  (if (case op
        ((p) (display (fam-task-monitored-paths ft)) (newline) #t)
        ((a) (fam-task-add-path ft (read-path) display-event))
        ((r) (fam-task-remove-path ft (read-path)))
        ((s) (fam-task-suspend-monitoring ft (read-path)))
        ((e) (fam-task-resume-monitoring ft (read-path)))
        (else #f))
      (display "OK")
      (display "KO"))
  (newline)
  (if (eq? op 'q) (fam-task-stop ft) (loop (read-op))))

(when (not (null? (fam-task-monitored-paths ft)))
  (display "You left some paths to monitor...")
  (unless (fam-task-join ft) (error "Couldn't restart monitoring")))
}

This example brings into play all the procedures exported by
\scm{fam-task}, with the exception of the predicte
\scm{fam-task-running?} (whose meaning I'll leave to the reader's
imagination). As you have surely noticed, there's no problem
restarting a stopped FAM task, the only caveat being that it remembers
the paths it was monitoring but will not catch any event that happened
while it was dead. One can also suspend and resume monitoring of a
previously added path, the difference with just add-remove-add being
that events associated with a suspended path are duly reported upon
resuming. The parameter \scm{fam-use-native?} tells us whether \MzFam\
has been able to contact a running FAM/Gamin daemon (and the
associated C library): if that's the case, \scm{(fam-use-native?)}
evaluates to \scm{#f}; otherwise the fall-back, pure-scheme
implementation is used\numfootnote{Some may find my use of ``native''
  in this context a bit misleading, but I like to think of Scheme as
  my native environment. So, please, humour me.}.

Incidentally, the monitoring program above has the dubious virtue of
exposing a situation where you may be tempted to use one of the
low-level modules directly: you just need to play with it a little and
get nervous when the output of \scm{display-event} gets mixed with the
loop's prompts. But of course, judicious use of MzScheme thread
synchronisation primitives should be a better option. There's also (at
least) one more clumsy thing about the above examples: we're
repeatedly using the \textit{same} event handler. No worries:
\scm{fam-task-create} accepts a default event handler as argument,
which gets used for monitored paths added without a specific one. That
is, you could fix the examples above by replacing the right calls by
something along the lines of:
\scm{
(define ft (fam-task-create display-event))
...
(fam-task-add-path ft path)
...
}

That's basically it. The next section explores some of the tweaks at
your disposal to fine-tune the behaviour of FAM tasks.

\section{Nuts and bolts}
\label{sec:nuts-bolts}

\subsection{FAM task flavours}
\label{sec:fam-task-flavours}

As mentioned, \scm{fam-task-create} will do its very best to contact a
running FAM or Gamin daemon and only when that attempt fails will fall
back to using the pure-Scheme monitor. Nevertheless, you can instruct
\MzFam\ to use the scheme implementation (provided by the \scm{fam-mz}
module) no matter what with \scm{(fam-use-native? #t)}, either in a
line of its own or as part of a \scm{parameterize} form. The native
implementation tries hard to provide the same functionality as the
FAM-based one, but falls short in a few (hopefully
minor\numfootnote{If these issues really matter to you and you're on
  GNU/Linux or any other system supporting the FAM daemon, the best
  solution is of course installing the latter and let \MzFam\ use it.
  I'm told (thank you, Chris) that on Windows there's a
  \urlh{http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365261.aspx}{similar
    C-level interface}, and one could use PLT's FFI to hook on that
  (as the \scm{fam} module does with \texttt{libfam})---I don't use
  Windows, so unless a kind contributor steps up, don't hold your
  breath on that. If you know of a similar kernel-level subsystem for
  Mac OS X, just drop me a line and I'll see what can be done.})
respects:
\begin{itemize}
\item Some, let's say, \textit{exotic} events, such as stop/start
  execution (see section~\ref{sec:fam-events} for details) are not
  detected, because the Scheme implementation operates exclusively on
  the basis of file modification times.
\item Blocking monitoring (see below) is only supported in FAM-based
  monitoring.
\item Some \textit{legit} events may be missed during the sleep period
  of the polling thread---for instance, if a file is deleted and
  re-created quickly enough, the Scheme monitor may report a 'file
  modified' event instead of a deletion/creation pair.
\end{itemize}

As hinted above, FAM tasks can operate in two modes, namely, polling
and blocking. In polling mode (the default) the thread sleeps for a
while, checks for new events, invokes the needed callback procedures,
processes requests for new, resumed or suspended paths and goes back
to sleep. The sleep period can be provided as an optional argument to
\scm{fam-task-create}. Its default value is \scm{0.01} (i.e., ten
milliseconds). Thus, if you want your FAM task to perfom its duties
(approximately) every half second, just create it with
\scm{(fam-task-create 0.5)}.

When the FAM/Gamin daemon is available, FAM tasks can operate in
blocking mode: they sleep as long as there're no pending events. You
request this operation mode using \scm{0} as the argument passed to
\scm{fam-task-create}. In principle, this may sound like a good way to
save a few CPU cycles, but a task that awakes every, say, 10 ms is not
what you'd call a resource hog and, more importantly, your FAM task
won't be able to attend new monitoring requests unless a new event
awakes it. Thus, blocking operation is probably only a good idea when
the set of monitored paths is fixed once and for all beforehand, or
when you'll want to modify it only if/when file alterations occur.

\subsection{Path monitoring knobs}
\label{sec:path-monit-knobs}

As we have seen, we tell FAM tasks to monitor a given path using
\scm{fam-task-add-path}, which in its simplest form takes a pathname
and a procedure of arity one as its arguments. The pathname can be
either absolute or relative: in the latter case, it's resolved with
respect the current working directory. The small print of how
pathnames are handled includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item If the pathname points to an existing file, the system figures
  by itself whether it denotes a directory or a regular file.
\item Pathnames pointing to non-existent files are allowed: if they
  spring into existence afterwards, they'll be monitored. A little
  help from you is needed, though: if you mean to monitor a would-be
  directory, the pathname should end with a path separator character
  (e.g., '/' in Unix systems). This limitation does not apply to files
  created during (possibly recursive) directory monitoring.
\end{itemize}
We have already mentioned that the third argument of
\scm{fam-task-add-path} is actually optional. In fact, this procedure
takes not one but \textit{three} optional arguments, namely, an event
handler, a list of event types, and a recursion flag (use \scm{#f} on
any of them to make it take its default value).

The list of event types is, well, a list of symbols representing the
events you're interested in (see section~\ref{sec:fam-events} for the
complete list of event types). For instance, this invocation requests
notifications (using the default event handler) for just creation and
modification events associated with the given path:
\scm{
(fam-task-add-path ft path #f '(FAMChanged FAMCreated))
}

The final optional argument is only using when the monitored path is a
directory. By default, monitoring a directory results in events
affecting its contents, but not the contents of any of its
subdirectories. In short, directory monitoring is \textbf{not}
recursive by default. Passing \scm{#t} as the last (fifth) argument of
\scm{fam-task-add-path} modifies this behaviour: any subdirectory
found (or subsequently created) inside the original path is added to
list of monitored paths, recursively. For instance,
calling
\scm{
(fam-task-add-path ft "/tmp/foo" handler events #t)
}
means that, if a directory \scm{"/tmp/foo/bar/"} is detected during
monitoring, the system will automatically make the following call for
you:
\scm{
(fam-task-add-path ft "/tmp/foo/bar" handler events #t)
}
Alternatively, you can provide an integer \textit{recursion level} as
the last parameter (where \scm{#f} stands for 0 and \scm{#t} for
infinite), which will be decremented each time a new subdirectory
level is entered. That is, if you add \scm{"/tmp/foo"} with
\scm{
(fam-task-add-path ft "/tmp/foo" handler events n)
}
\scm{"/tmp/foo/bar"} (as well as any other direct child of
\texttt{foo}) will be added using
\scm{
(fam-task-add-path ft "/tmp/foo/bar" handler events (- n 1))
}
and yes, you guessed right: zero means the recursion stops.
